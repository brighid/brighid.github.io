    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am writing while angry.
One of my current classes is in Flash.
As a result, I&rsquo;m installing <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/">Flash CS3</a> at home so that I can experiment with it outside of the school&rsquo;s labs and so that I can work on Flash assignments at my own pace.</p>

<p>Flash&rsquo;s installer is terrible.</p>

<p>Among the first things that it does is to boldly fall face-first into the pavement of prerequisites.
It tells me that it&rsquo;s installing some browser widgets and that I must quit Firefox.
This is shoddy design.
I accept, happily, that in the course of installing Flash, I must install some Flash-viewing software for my browser.
However, you don&rsquo;t get to restart my browser.
Firefox already has a mildly elegant mechanism for installing extensions to its functionality.
It installs them and then tells me &ldquo;okay, restart the browser when you want to use this.&rdquo;  It does things on my schedule.
Not using that mechanism, when it exists, is poor workmanship.
As it happened, I was at a low ebb of Firefox usage at the time.
Normally I have 50 tabs open spread across multiple windows, making <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4199">restarting the browser</a> a bit time-consuming.</p>

<p>I put my attention elsewhere and kept working with the installer running in the background.
Then I rebooted.
Excuse me, that was the wrong pronoun.
<em>It</em> rebooted.
This splits into two problems.
One is that Windows programs very often demand a system reboot unjustifiably.
I have to suppose that that&rsquo;s related to problems with Windows itself.
The other is that Flash CS3 in particular rebooted without giving me a choice in the matter.
Either the installer stole focus and it heard the right keystrokes for &ldquo;go ahead and reboot&rdquo; in the middle of the command I was typing, or it just rebooted without giving me a confirmation dialogue box.
The first is extremely bad, and the second is demonstrate-the-power-of-this-fully-armed-and-operational-battlestation bad.
I&rsquo;m not going to bother spending time on why the second one is bad - if you don&rsquo;t get that it&rsquo;s bad to do that and why, I forbid you to become involved in any way in creating software.
If you meet the person responsible for this feature of the Flash installer in an alcohol-serving setting, throw a drink in their face.</p>

<p>Stealing focus is one of the classic user experience sins.
It is pure hubris.
It says &ldquo;this application exists for <em>our</em> needs, not for our users' needs.&rdquo;  That is pride, and that is a great reason for your users to take their business somewhere else.
If your product doesn&rsquo;t exist for your customers' needs, why should they (we) care about it?  Back on stealing focus: even though Mac OS X&rsquo;s bouncing Dock icons can get obnoxious, they&rsquo;re at least an intuitive way of communicating &ldquo;hey, this application needs your attention!&rdquo;  Windows has flashing taskbar entries and system-tray notifications (which are usually used badly, but that&rsquo;s no reason not to use them).
Your application shouldn&rsquo;t steal focus from what the user is actually doing for anything short of &ldquo;your computer will physically explode unless you click a button in the next 30 seconds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I learned this from <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/biggest-mistakes-in-web-design-1995-2015.html#1">Vincent Flanders</a>, myself.
It is a pole star of design.
You design <strong>for your users</strong>, not for yourself or for your organization.
Even if you are a rock star like <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html">The Steve</a>, you design for users.
Even if your application is (like Adobe&rsquo;s Flash creation tools) targeted at developers, those are your users, and you design for them.
The targeting of developers actually makes Flash&rsquo;s terrible installer even more problematic.
If the profit center for Flash were content consumers, it&rsquo;d be at least vaguely justifiable for the content creation software to have problems.
But instead, Flash makes money by selling content creation software.
It is free to content consumers.
You&rsquo;d suppose that Adobe would like to make the content creators happy, then, since they&rsquo;re the ones that are actually giving Adobe money.</p>

<p>Instead, Flash is dying.
I can&rsquo;t bring myself to be sad about that, even putting aside the problems I just had with installing Flash.
Flash is great for embedding video.
That&rsquo;s it.
I can&rsquo;t think of anything else Flash does that can&rsquo;t be imitated with a combination of CSS and JavaScript, with better SEO, better accessibility, and cheaper content-creation tools.
Now we&rsquo;ve got HTML5, a standard getting ever closer, and it includes video and audio embedding that don&rsquo;t need Flash, nor do they open the user up to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=flash+zero+day+exploit">Flash&rsquo;s numerous security problems</a>.</p>

<p>This is all moderately predictable, too.
Despite the existence of Silverlight (too little, too late), Flash was essentially a monopoly for a while.
Predicting that monopolies will deliver shitty products is pretty easy.
It&rsquo;s what monopolies do, and it&rsquo;s part of why HTML5 is a better solution than Silverlight.
Silverlight would have made things into a competition between Adobe and Microsoft, which is better than a monopoly, but not as good as the HTML5 solution, which doesn&rsquo;t require installing additional software and lets people concentrate on more interesting problems than embedding video.
Silverlight is just more of <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html">Flash&rsquo;s problems</a>: not searchable, poor accessibility, security issues.
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/html5_video_unusable">HTML5 has its own problems</a>, but they&rsquo;re vendor-independent.</p>

<p>I will take this class, I will attain baseline competency in Flash, and I will keep Flash the hell out of any web site I author.
It is a product whose time is up.</p>
