    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are several software components that are pretty universally found on the toolbelts of professional programmers.
For example, it&rsquo;s normal to have a favorite IDE/text editor.
It doesn&rsquo;t entirely matter whether you like the visphere, Eclipse, Visual Studio, or emacs - it matters that you&rsquo;ve put some thought into mastering a serious tool that enables high-level work.
As a programmer, there isn&rsquo;t really an alternative: other things held equal, someone who&rsquo;s spent the time to get good at (for example) Eclipse will be more productive than you if you haven&rsquo;t gotten good at such a tool.
The things on the toolbelt are all like that, they make massively increased productivity possible.</p>

<p>Such a tool is version control.
By now we&rsquo;re all used to saving documents.
Version control is like the superpowers version of saving a document: you save the way it was at a specific time, in a continuum of ways it was, and the system nearly coerces you into leaving behind a reason for <em>why</em> you saved it at that time and in that state.</p>

<p><em>Distributed</em> version control - the current flagbearers are <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, and <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/">Bazaar</a> - ups the ante even further by making it much easier for lots of people to work on a project at once and still have that superpower saving.
The difference that the toolkit makes is even more important in group contexts: there are a lot of big projects that we rely on, invisibly, in just using the Internet and living our lives, that would be <strong>impossible</strong> without version control.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using Git and Mercurial now, gaining proficiency with them, and I&rsquo;ve used a bit of Subversion, a non-distributed version control system.
Part of my mission for 2010 is to assemble a toolbelt.
Right now, it&rsquo;s looking like it&rsquo;ll be emacs, Mercurial, FogBugz, Firefox/Firebug, SysInternals' ProcMon/ProcExp/Autoruns, Stack Overflow (and its siblings), bash and a little PowerShell, Ethereal/Wireshark, and by the way, yes, the toolbelt gets crowded.
That&rsquo;s part of why learning to use it well is so important: all of those tools <em>matter</em> to your productivity as a programmer.
I should note that the sysadmin side of my brain is going to end up using a lot of those tools, too.</p>

    <updated>2010-03-11T22:01:13-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://stronglyemergent.com//blog/2010/sharpening-my-saw-emacs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently re-read <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/sharpening-the-saw.html">Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s post about sharpening your saw</a>.
It has me thinking about my personal work habits and my toolkit.
I&rsquo;m going to be writing about parts of my workflow from time to time, and exploring options.
Today, the saw in question is emacs.</p>

<p>I started using emacs about six months ago, and it&rsquo;s gotten to the point where I can&rsquo;t imagine getting programming <em>work</em> done without it.
I didn&rsquo;t realize how much time I was using moving my hands around until I started using a program that&rsquo;s got a monomania about keeping your fingers near the home keys.
At this point I have an unconditional love for emacs and I plan to be using it for the rest of my life as a Computer Person.
<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge</a> can tell you at great length why emacs is so great, but the main thing that makes me happy is this: I can grow with emacs.
Right now, I&rsquo;m getting some pretty good mileage out of it.
As I get better at the craft, I&rsquo;ll be able to get even more out of emacs - and because it embeds one of the best domain languages out there, the upper limit of how much I can get out of emacs is so far away it might as well be measured in light years.
The local maximum of efficiency with emacs is a very, very big peak - and because getting there requires that I actively optimize emacs to myself, it&rsquo;s a peak unique to me, which makes it all the higher.</p>

<p>One symptom of this is that it&rsquo;s gotten into my life in a variety of ways.
I try to control Firefox by emacs keystrokes sometimes and I have to stop myself.
It has definitely heightened my tendency to do everything from my keyboard instead of reaching for the mouse (my intermittent wrist issues only encourage this pattern).
That&rsquo;s definitely an interesting phenomenon when a tool produces it, and it&rsquo;s worth looking into further.</p>

<p>One of the most important things to remember about this saw-sharpening, though, is that it&rsquo;s about <em>your</em> saw.
Professionals in a given field tend to converge around a constellation of tools, but each has their own favorite for their own reason.
So if you&rsquo;re reading this, that means you - and that means that you have an obligation not to stick with a tool that&rsquo;s not well-suited to you.</p>

<p>Finally, as long as we&rsquo;re talking about straight text editors, I&rsquo;m going to encourage those of you who do work in Windows towards <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a>.
It&rsquo;s just the best notepad replacement you can get in Windows.
Even if you only use it for syntax highlighting, tabbed multiple-file handling, and regular expression searching, it is a beautiful shining gift from the open-source world and will make your life better.</p>
