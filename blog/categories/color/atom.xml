    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every so often Pantone blows my mind.
Their business model is that they <em>sell colors</em>—not that they sell paint or ink or dye, no, they sell <em>colors!</em>
It’s a little unbelievable.
Of course if you venture into the world of printing, publishing, and large-scale content creation in general,
color is just one of many important details that have to not only be right, but right in a way that you can talk to others sensibly about.
So Pantone can be thought of as a standards body like ISO—
and like ISO, they aren’t cheap, and they look rather surreal from the outside.</p>

<p>They’re a great lesson in that way, though:
sometimes to understand odd things, you have to meet them on their own terms, not on yours.
Otherwise you’ll be looking at <a href="http://www.pantone.com/pages/index.aspx?pg=21055">“Emerald is the color of the year!”</a> and be staring at your monitor mouthing
“what the devil does that mean, who decided that, how the heck is a color ‘lush’?”
But it makes perfect sense on its own terms.
Like many other things in the world, it exists for itself and those who know it, not for strangers.</p>

<p>Of course, you may want to treat my opinion on the matter with skepticism
since I’m the kind of person who finds the <a href="http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=1376&amp;ca=33">Emerald Pantone iPhone Case</a> mildly fetching.</p>
