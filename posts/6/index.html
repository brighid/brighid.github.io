  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is basically the sysadmin equivalent of posting pictures of your cat - but hey, I&rsquo;m happy with how things are turning out.
This is what my home network is going to look like soon - I have to do a few OS installs to get there, that&rsquo;s all.
I&rsquo;m glad I have MSDN AA access so that I can do all of this legally - having to deal with licensing requirements is something I&rsquo;m not looking forward to about the Professional World.</p>

<p><img src="/images/brighid_network.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I figure that with judicious use of virtualization, I can simulate a rather larger network.
I&rsquo;ll definitely need to simulate a larger network in the course of working with Active Directory and its constellation of interesting features.
If so, I&rsquo;ll have to go back to <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a>, where I made this, and redo it.
Already I&rsquo;m recalling that I omitted a printer in there - it&rsquo;s attached to the Ubuntu server, shared with CUPS/Samba, which was not as painful to set up as it might have been.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m serious about this when I take it to Visio.
Visio diagrams make everything serious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a problem with textbooks anyhow.
In a classroom environment, you are presented with a body of knowledge that you need to absorb.
There are two primary things you need: knowledge and narrative.
Textbooks, in a noble but doomed effort, usually try to present both.
However, we know enough now about different learning styles that it&rsquo;s easy to see how costly it is to try and stick just one narrative onto a body of information.
Additionally, in a technical subject, it&rsquo;s hard to strike a balance between comprehensiveness and relevance.</p>

<p>Consider one of my current classes: Managing And Maintaining A Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Environment.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80-20 rule</a> is in full effect here: 80% of the users will only need about 20% of Server 2003&rsquo;s features.
The problem is that they&rsquo;ll all need different 20% slices.
A physical textbook, limited by space constraints, will contain a lot of material that&rsquo;s irrelevant to a given sysadmin-in-training - and they won&rsquo;t be able to tell what&rsquo;s relevant and what&rsquo;s not for quite some time.
That&rsquo;s a problem.
There isn&rsquo;t a single narrative that suits a datacenter worker, a helpdesk worker, and a small business' Designated IT Person.
So it&rsquo;s unreasonable to ask a textbook writer to anticipate all that and organize information to somehow fit all of them.</p>

<p>My preferred solution is to use reference works instead of textbooks.
Have a human supplying the narrative: <em>that&rsquo;s what humans are good at!</em>
Don&rsquo;t make textbook writers strive to do the impossible.
Self-teaching textbooks can feel free to attempt it, but for a classroom environment, let humans do what humans are good at and let book/digital encoded information do what it&rsquo;s good at.
This won&rsquo;t happen at my school, though, for reasons that are neither satisfying to me nor productive to elaborate on.</p>

<p>The textbooks that I&rsquo;m currently using are good examples of this.
I have two textbooks that are in the Teach Yourself Whatever mold.
The better one is the Adobe Classroom in a Book: Photoshop one, and the one about the Win9x/NT/XP command-line environment is crappish.
Part of this is their suitability to my needs.
I like Photoshop - it&rsquo;s still basically the best at what it does - and I&rsquo;m enthused about finding out new tricks with it even when the book is tediously plodding through basic techniques that I already know.
That contrasts with the command-line book.
Despite that I&rsquo;m learning some new tricks, the DOS command line, even with NT updates, feels like dealing with a Faulknerian idiot man-child after working with bash and PowerShell.
I know that there are a lot of scriptable utilities that make Windows Server much more manageable, but those are not attracting my attention right now.
What attracts my attention is how painful the DOS shell is to work with.
I need more practice at it because it&rsquo;s essential to managing a Windows Server environment well, but it&rsquo;s one of those things that aggravates me because it feels like it&rsquo;s actively sucking time away from useful things.
I want to enter the job market with minimal legacy skills, so my patience for Win9x/DOS lore presented as utility instead of history is pretty low.</p>

<p>On the positive side, I can view this as an opportunity for me: creating useful narratives is one of My Things, so I should put that skill into practice by taking reference works in my own time and building narrative around them.
Which is how I&rsquo;m trying to learn programming/development skills.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course, having bloviated to the tune of 2000+ words about Apple and narrative, I can&rsquo;t avoid thinking about Microsoft and narrative.
Microsoft&rsquo;s narratives are particularly annoying to me right now because I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time with my nose in Microsoft Press books and grinding through practice tests for Microsoft certifications.
Microsoft has narrative problems in these books.</p>

<p>The main thing is that reading the books feels like reading a bad help file on the computer: the help isn&rsquo;t helpful.
It doesn&rsquo;t tell a story well - and, crucially, it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what matters.
In a reference work, this would be halfway forgivable, but I&rsquo;m reading tutorial works, books that are intended to take you from near-zero to competence with a given Microsoft product, and they&rsquo;re falling down on that.
They are basically giant for-each loops that go through most of the features of the product.
They take a stance that&rsquo;s both egotistical and careless - that <em>everything</em> is important.</p>

<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong!
If you&rsquo;ve ever gotten emails from someone who puts URGENT in the subject line of everything that they send you, you already have experienced how this is wrong.
Good narrative requires that important things look important, and that there be a clear spectrum of importance.
You don&rsquo;t need to say that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all important.&rdquo;
When someone picks up the book, they are implicitly assuming that everything in it is important or you wouldn&rsquo;t have printed it.
They are counting on you, the writer and publisher and editor, to make sure that everything past the threshold of &ldquo;important enough to be in the book&rdquo; is spread out into an easily visible sub-spectrum of importance.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s even more obnoxious that things lack this narrative structure when you consider that the books I&rsquo;m working with are class textbooks with accompanying lab manuals, tests, and review questions.
The tests are perfect opportunities to reinforce and remind students of the relative importance of things.
But the books are so flat, so determinedly agnostic about what&rsquo;s important, that the tests and review questions are the only way to tease out information about that hierarchy of importance - and their helpfulness is severely undermined by the way that they contrast with the book.
It is an uphill battle to extract a hierarchy of importance from the tests and homework.
It also creates a sense that there&rsquo;s mere memorization to be done and that the tests are loaded with trick questions.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s very, very bad.
I don&rsquo;t argue for the tests being artificially easy - but right now the material is artificially hard because it doesn&rsquo;t clue you in to what&rsquo;s important.
As a result, when I go through practice exams, it feels like they&rsquo;re asking for trivia.
They want me to memorize which tab of which control panel a given setting is in, instead of knowing what that setting does and when I&rsquo;d need it.
They&rsquo;re also trapped by the need to demonstrate how much you can do with Microsoft products, and so it&rsquo;s common for them to contrive situations in which various features are necessary.
I&rsquo;m down with that, but it has a very high risk of adding to the sense of &ldquo;there is no organizing principle going on here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frustratingly, it&rsquo;s not like Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t have usage data.
They&rsquo;ve got oodles.
They keep a close eye on this stuff - or they should.
So it shouldn&rsquo;t be spectacularly difficult for them to identify good candidates for emphasis.
Their tutorial materials, training the people who will run Microsoft-based facilities in the future, need to be clear and pitch a story - a story about what happens when you run Microsoft clients, Microsoft servers, Microsoft infrastructure.
I want to give them a chance to tell a compelling story about the features of their product.
You&rsquo;ll use this every day.
You&rsquo;ll use this every week if you&rsquo;re in such-and-such kind of network, and otherwise never.
You&rsquo;ll use this once every 18 months, and that one time it will save your ass.
That kind of lore should be spread around.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m actually pulling for Microsoft when I read these guides.
I realize that their products can do some pretty compelling and astonishing things.
Yet it still feels like listening to someone with a stammer trying to read the <em>I Have A Dream</em> speech - great content, but the delivery, oy.
Microsoft Official Academic Courses should be better than this: they should, even if they have to invent one, impose a narrative onto a collection of facts so that those facts can easily enter and remain in the human brains of sysadmins-in-training.
They should reinforce that narrative with tests, labs, and review questions that are all in sync, emphasizing the same hierarchy of importance.
Finally, for bonus points, they should tie into an existing body of community lore about how to run an IT infrastructure the Microsoft Way.
Microsoft&rsquo;s company-wide ability to do this <em>kind</em> of thing hasn&rsquo;t penetrated the Microsoft Official Academic Courses that I&rsquo;ve read, and I really hope that their later crops are better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re all clear on the fact that Apple has a new device coming out.
It&rsquo;s the iPad, it&rsquo;s going to Change The World.
Great.
Apple&rsquo;s best marketing asset, I believe, is their ability to get all of us talking about their stuff.
It&rsquo;s a pretty pure example of the &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing as bad publicity&rdquo; philosophy: whether we&rsquo;re damning Apple or praising them, we&rsquo;re still talking about them, thinking about them, giving them uncountable dollars of free marketing.
Pulling that off, not just once but repeatedly, is impressive.</p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> I have an opinion about the iPad.
Last month&rsquo;s hyper-excitement has died down a little, but we&rsquo;re all still talking about the dang thing.
I see two important things about the iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Apple got into the processor business</strong>: this is pretty fascinating to me.
If there&rsquo;s a word for Apple under the hand of Jobs, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;gutsy,&rdquo; and deciding to compete with Intel, Motorola and ARM is definitely bold.
Intel, for all that it&rsquo;s not backing the Atom very well, is still in the portable-device-CPU market, and Motorola and ARM are heavily invested in mobile.
Jobs directly positioned Apple as a player in mobile with actions in the past few years, and directly in his iPad announcement speech, so the A4 has to be seen as competing at least a little with the established players.
Of course, they&rsquo;re probably prone to thinking that Apple wants to Take Over The Market.
I&rsquo;m pretty sure that they want no such thing.
As with desktops and Macbooks, Apple wants to be the perfect salesman, selling only to those who are going to buy and leaving the scraps for others.
Apple doesn&rsquo;t want to please everyone - not the way that Google pleases everyone, and certainly not the way that Microsoft tries to please everyone.</p>

<p>Apple wants to please Apple&rsquo;s kind of people.
You&rsquo;ll notice that they&rsquo;ve been pretty damn good at that.
That we can all tell you about the stereotypical Mac user is an interesting feat of marketing.
True or not, Apple has narrative mojo all over the place - and that mojo is focused on attaining 100% market share among Apple&rsquo;s kind of people.
They&rsquo;re doing pretty well at that.
The iPad isn&rsquo;t very bold if you look at it that way: it embodies the proposition that perhaps there are a few people out there that are Apple&rsquo;s kind of people and who haven&rsquo;t bought into the Apple ecosystem at all yet, and who would do so if they got a tablet.
Thus, a tablet.
Otherwise, Apple is not hugely concerned with selling themselves to people who don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to be Apple&rsquo;s kind of people.
Apple&rsquo;s doing pretty well at the game of not losing customers - I&rsquo;ve never seen them release a product that made people <em>who were already in the Apple Lifestyle</em> say &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s it I&rsquo;m never using another Apple product again!&rdquo;  People do leave the Applesphere, but that&rsquo;s not what pushes them out.</p>

<p>So here sits Apple, with a track record of fairly canny moves and good design, plus a pretty damn good marketing machine, plus a reputation that most Fortune 500 companies would kill for.
Kevin Roberts calls this a &ldquo;lovemark,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;d paraphrase as the kind of product that not only makes people fall in love with it, make it part of their lives, but which also makes them want to evangelize.
And if there&rsquo;s a defining characteristic of the Mac user stereotype, it&rsquo;s that the Mac user is perfectly willing to tell you how great Macs are.
At length.
And Apple&rsquo;s narrative-fu is so strong that despite the massive difference in market cap and bankroll between them and Redmond, they&rsquo;ve managed to define the PC user stereotype as someone who complains about their frequently-broken Windows machine.</p>

<p>Thus, Apple enters the processor business for about the same reason that it does anything else: to make gobsmacking amounts of money by selling Apple products to Apple&rsquo;s kind of people, and slowly, strategically, with risk aversion that would make a casino owner proud, grow the number of Apple&rsquo;s kind of people in the world.
This is part of why, as someone who investigates the connection between narrative, humans, and computers, I am awed by Apple.
For all the many legitimate complaints about Apple the company, the products of Apple the company, and Steve Jobs the person, Apple is just <em>damn</em> good at this business of producing stories that people want to become part of.
Apple is so damn slick.
They are essentially a high-octane design and marketing firm that just happens to sell computers.
Jobs is not kidding when he says that Apple is selling a lifestyle, as he used to when &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; was a buzzword.
Apple continues to kick ass where it counts because they have defined victory conditions for themselves that are both different from and more attainable than the goals of other companies, and because they are spectacularly good at narrative.
It suffuses what they do.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it this way.
When Justin Long stands in front of that plain white background and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Mac,&rdquo; and John Hodgman cheerily follows up with &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m a PC,&rdquo; Apple is nakedly making narrative.
For the longest time there just was no serious competition with them.
Even when Microsoft replied, they used Apple&rsquo;s narrative - <em>a narrative within which it was impossible for them to win</em>.
Still, you might actually have a significant mental image now when someone says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Windows user.&rdquo;
Microsoft&rsquo;s marketing department has gotten that far.
But &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Dell user&rdquo;?
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Asus user&rdquo;?
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an HP user&rdquo;?
No, no, no.
Utter blanks as far as personification.
You may have some images of the products' identity, especially if you&rsquo;re part of the enthusiast market.
But I guarantee you that only people who are already neck-deep in caring about computers can call to mind a mental image of &ldquo;Dell user,&rdquo; &ldquo;Asus user,&rdquo; or &ldquo;HP user&rdquo; that&rsquo;s <em>remotely</em> near as clear as those archetypes that Apple is defining through Long and Hodgman.</p>

<p>With the tablet, Apple has made another Apple product which they will sell to Apple&rsquo;s kind of people and make another incremental gain in the definition of &ldquo;Apple&rsquo;s kind of people.&rdquo;
Apple, Apple, Apple.
Seriously, they are playing a whole different game than the rest of the industry.
They are currently set to win, by the way - to win by <em>their</em> definition, which might not look the way you expect it to, and people who think that they&rsquo;re competing with Apple are going to feel like they&rsquo;re losing quite often because they&rsquo;ll do what they think will cause them to win and Apple to lose - and it will slide right off of Apple because they&rsquo;re playing a different game.
And those people will think that Apple is beating them, when it&rsquo;s not doing that either.
For example, people who think that Apple wants to put its OS everywhere are going to go make deals with OEMs to put their OS, not Apple&rsquo;s, on desktops and laptops and phones.
And those people are going to be puzzled when having a tiny slice of market share doesn&rsquo;t make Apple shrivel up and die - because Apple&rsquo;s market share is robust and healthy among the people that Apple cares about selling to.
It goes the same way in other businesses.</p>

<p>This actually brings us to the other thing that I care about with the iPad: <strong>Apple is using its applications as a powerful asset</strong>.
For one, it&rsquo;s a pretty great coup that already the applications - 90% of what people care about with the iPhone and iPod Touch - virtually all run on the iPad.
They&rsquo;re exploiting the success of the iPhone quite well there.
Every single &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an app for that&rdquo; ad that they&rsquo;ve run in the past years just got a tiny bit more valuable, because all those apps will work on the iPad as well as the other two devices.
That&rsquo;s a pretty deft move.
They also made sure that you can transfer apps you&rsquo;ve already bought from your iPod/iPhone to your iPad.
Considerate of them.</p>

<p>The thing with the applications is that it brings up Apple&rsquo;s sinister side.
As <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5458690/">Adam Pash points out</a>, Apple is still holding onto the walled-garden model of app development.
I see a slightly different tradeoff involved here.
For anyone in the consumer mindset, it is entirely irrelevant that Apple harshes on developers - as long as they can find an app that does what they need.
That conditional clause is critical, though.
The people who <em>do</em> care that the App Store is broken - and for them it is, badly - are developers.
No developers, no apps; no apps, no compelling reasons to get an iPad.
We love to mock that speech, but Ballmer was deadly serious when he was up on that stage chanting &ldquo;Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers.&rdquo;
For all the narrative work Apple&rsquo;s done, there still must be things you can do with their products that are worth your time to do.
Hence, apps - and hence why Apple has stayed in the first-party app business tenaciously, producing Safari, Mail, iTunes, iPhoto, and a hundred other basics that come bundled with a Mac.
They&rsquo;re making sure that there&rsquo;s something to <em>do</em> once you&rsquo;re in the Applesphere immediately, and something that doesn&rsquo;t require you to wade through the endless crapware installed with most Windows machines purchased at retail.</p>

<p>Part of why Apple gets away with being so controlling and jerkish about apps for the iPhone OS is that thing about selling to Apple&rsquo;s kind of people.
Apple has a pretty good read on what Apple&rsquo;s kind of people want - and that means that imposing those restrictions, when they&rsquo;re right, isn&rsquo;t that big a deal.
Apple&rsquo;s spin is that they&rsquo;re restricting developers to what developers would end up doing anyhow: catering to Apple users.
But developers themselves are not at all guaranteed to be Apple&rsquo;s kind of people: developers may come to Apple for entirely different reasons.
Anyone who uses an Apple product because of its Unix guts, for example, stands a pretty good chance of not actually being Apple&rsquo;s kind of people.
Apple&rsquo;s kind of people, I would say, have better things to do with their time than tinker with a computer - they want to be doing a task.
Watching their movie, looking at their web sites, showing off their photos.
Apple happily enables those tasks.</p>

<p>Developers, on the other hand, want to look under the hood, poke around, and adjust things.
They want to bend the computer to their personal idiom of what a computer should do.
This is why they develop software: they want to impose their will on the computer (although usually it&rsquo;s much, much less Nietzschean than that and more like &ldquo;I want a Twitter client that doesn&rsquo;t suck&rdquo; or &ldquo;I need to provide clever services to the real estate agents that work for my company&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wonder what happens if I write a database that works in a different way&rdquo;).
Apple has already imposed a ton of will on that computer, and so Apple has baked in a certain amount of resistance to developers.</p>

<p>They know that they need developers, and they actively court developers - but one of the flaws of the Apple way of doing things is that it can&rsquo;t avoid a certain degree of hostility to developers.
Developers care about things that Apple&rsquo;s customers don&rsquo;t (even when developers buy MacBooks and iPhones and, inevitably, iPads).
Fortunately, Apple can give developers most of what they want without having to upset the average iPhone buyer - but they&rsquo;re reluctant to go too far with that, because the more ground they give to the developers, the harder it&rsquo;ll be to keep control of the Apple narrative.
They are damn right to be reluctant, to my mind: the Apple narrative is their biggest corporate asset.</p>

<p>Thus, Apple balances those concerns: trying to make their customers happy and trying to make their developers happy.
Apple is good enough at the former that if that&rsquo;s all they had to do, I would expect them to keep incrementally growing until they own the planet.
But making developers happy is something that Apple is merely average at - and that, I think, represents a genuine risk to them.
Not a risk that&rsquo;ll make them go out of business in the next quarter, the next year, even the next decade.
I would say that Apple&rsquo;s huge narrative power is so much of a boost that it lets them mostly ignore the developer issue.
However, if the narrative power vanishes - and it&rsquo;ll certainly take a big, big hit when Jobs inevitably kicks the bucket - Apple will have to be prepared to deal with its game from less of a position of strength.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;ll be worth watching, once it happens - and that&rsquo;ll leave open a space for someone with another really kick-ass narrative and a great design team to step up and become the company that befuddles the rest of its industry with the way it just doesn&rsquo;t lose, even when it really should, because it&rsquo;s playing a different game and telling a different story.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All right, that&rsquo;s one month of blogging, all on schedule, all reasonable content.
Here goes month two.
I will make a little meta post like this at the beginning of the month, reviewing myself publicly.
Right now, there are three meta issues that are on my mind.</p>

<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m not done customizing WordPress.
I need to add a few more static pages, tweak this theme more (that animated favicon isn&rsquo;t working out as well as I&rsquo;d hoped), and do some plugin management.
Also figure out permalink structure so that I can write future-compatible posts and theme tweaks.</li>
<li>My best post last month was <a href="http://stronglyemergent.com/blog/2010/the-best-software-developer-youve-never-heard-of/">The Best Software Developer You&rsquo;ve Never Heard Of</a>.
It was better than <a href="http://stronglyemergent.com/blog/2010/meaningful-work-in-my-future/">Meaningful Work In My Future</a>, my second favorite, because more of the content was original to me.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the post that I should have put through more thought and more drafts was definitely <a href="http://stronglyemergent.com/blog/2010/textbook-economics/">Textbook Economics</a>.
Totally phoning it in there.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the future, the first post of each month will probably be a metapost like this, and will definitely have a best/worst review of what I&rsquo;ve written over the previous month.
I&rsquo;m willing to call one full month a landmark, but it&rsquo;s only one in a series.
I&rsquo;ll pat myself on the back again after a full quarter, a half-year, and a year.
Getting there is going to be interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course, after spending most of 400 words complaining in my last post, an obvious question comes up: <em>well, what are you going to do about it?</em>
What I&rsquo;m doing about it is writing up a course - and more than one, if I get a positive reception - that will let me create the hybrid curriculum I want, and pitching it to the school&rsquo;s administration.
I&rsquo;ve used Google Docs to <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddvszwtj_44hpttscd3">write up a course proposal</a> (which is going to keep being updated, it&rsquo;s very much work-in-progress) for the first thing I have in mind.</p>

<p>What I have in mind is using <a href="http://pylonshq.com">Pylons</a>.
Pylons is an open-source web framework built on Python.
I&rsquo;ve been working on Python gradually on my own time, but I&rsquo;m not happy with my progress.
I haven&rsquo;t been making progress because I haven&rsquo;t been putting in enough time.
Therefore, I want to create a school project in which I have to use Pylons because that will require me to put in more time on it, and give me a structure for using my time.
That&rsquo;s pretty much the most useful thing that I get from school: I could get most of the information from pure reference works freely available (appearances to the contrary, it&rsquo;s not like Microsoft or Red Hat <em>want</em> to keep people from knowing how to run their servers well), but school gives it structure and enacts a framework for practice.
Practice - that Gladwellian 10,000 hours - is essential.
So when I have a structure for my time, it&rsquo;s easier to put in the purposeful practice required to achieve proficiency (and after that, mastery).</p>

<p>Fortunately, this project of creating a Pylons class has an excellent fallback position.
Even if I don&rsquo;t persuade the school to let me take my course - and it&rsquo;s definitely not a sure thing - I can use that framework to structure my own time and make more progress.
So I&rsquo;m happy about that.
I wouldn&rsquo;t design the course if I had already done all of the work - as it is, I&rsquo;m designing the course around what I need to learn, and it&rsquo;s an interesting challenge to develop a plan for learning things that I don&rsquo;t yet know.
I definitely think that my path will be easier if I can save the school&rsquo;s administration as much work as possible.
I want to plop down a sheaf of paper for them and say - &ldquo;here is <em>the whole course</em>, how about letting me do it?&rdquo;
I will give them a syllabus, quizzes and answer keys, homework assignments, a textbook, and a letter of recommendation from someone saying &ldquo;yeah these are marketable skills.&rdquo;
I hope that they&rsquo;ll find that persuasive.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another reason to craft this course, though, that I should have covered in the last post.
I hope that it will replace some courses here that <em>suck</em>.
Unless you&rsquo;re getting into serious mojo and/or VBA, Word and Excel are not suitable subjects for technical college classes.
Learning to use them up to a basic, everyday level is a long afternoon&rsquo;s work.
The curriculum here feels padded with classes like that, that have no place in seriously preparing for a job in the IT world.
I&rsquo;m familiar with and sympathetic to the argument that peripheral skills are near in importance to technical skills, and that preparation for the professional world should be holistic, but come on.
I feel like my tuition is not well spent when it is spent on content-free classes.
So as far as I possibly can, I&rsquo;m going to roll my own education, I&rsquo;m going to pitch classes at the Administration that are <em>not</em> content-free, and use them to replace content-free classes.</p>

<p>Setting a goal and working with a bureaucratic institution to get it, crafting a proposal, negotiating, accepting a higher work-load in order to have more gratifying work?  <em>Those</em> are career skills I want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now I&rsquo;m studying at a career college, and I&rsquo;m bumping up against the limits of that.
I feel like I should be in a computer-science program somewhere, but my track record excludes that.
Fine.
I can build towards that goal - and in the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to build as much of a computer-science curriculum as I can out of the sysadmin curriculum on offer here.
I hope that I&rsquo;ll end up with some interesting hybrid, and that&rsquo;s useful to strive for.</p>

<p>The actual sysadmin track here is interesting to me, and looks useful.
It covers a lot of things that are very interesting to me: how to actually run a for-serious network, both in the Microsoft Way and in one iteration of the Unix Ways.
That&rsquo;s totally interesting to me.
I feel like it shies away from some things that I feel are necessities of really proficient sysadmin work, though.
One teacher told me recently that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re trying not to get into programming courses.&rdquo;
Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting goal, but being a good sysadmin means knowing when to automate so you can spend your time most efficiently.
You&rsquo;re not going to be a good sysadmin unless you can spend your time very efficiently, and that means that you&rsquo;re going to need to automate at least sometimes, and that means perl, that means PowerShell, that means bash scripting, that may even mean Python, Ruby, PHP, AppleScript, and VBA.</p>

<p>To fill this need, the college currently assigns a teeny little slice of the later Windows Server classes, a little slice of the Linux classes, and a dedicated class based on Windows 9x/NT/XP batch files.
This is not satisfying.
While it&rsquo;s much better than nothing, and it&rsquo;s great for introducing the concept that as much of a server as possible should be scriptable, it seems very lacking to me.
It doesn&rsquo;t expose the full scope of the problem domain that scripting can address, and it binds students into a crippled environment with ugly syntax, the MS-DOS command line.
Either bash scripting or PowerShell should be incorporated - PowerShell is built into Windows 2008 and seems to have plenty of life in it, and the corpus of existing bash lore is very large.
Both of these would serve students better than the minimal scripting knowledge that&rsquo;s currently being imparted by the school&rsquo;s curriculum.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Atwood <a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/7896822753">made a Twitter post recently</a> that looped back to his three-years-ago post about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">&ldquo;The FizzBuzz Problem.&rdquo;</a>
I read the post, and I experienced a distinct need to self-check.
I spent 10-20 minutes and came up with this:</p>

<blockquote><h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<pre><code>import sys
ournumbers = range(1, 101)
def fizzer (x):
        if (x % 3):
                return None
        else:
                return "fizz, "
def buzzer (x):
        if (x % 5):
                return None
        else:
                return "buzz, "
for x in ournumbers:
        if fizzer(x) and buzzer(x):
                sys.stdout.write("fizzbuzz, ")
        else:
                if fizzer(x):
                        sys.stdout.write(fizzer(x))
                        continue
                if buzzer(x):
                        sys.stdout.write(buzzer(x))
                        continue
                sys.stdout.write("%d, " % x)
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Now, as Atwood&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000804.html">immediate follow-up post</a> points out, this is nothing to be particularly proud of.
It&rsquo;s a <em>minimal</em> test of competency.
Still, I&rsquo;m heartened by the fact that I straightaway knew how to do it, I just had to look up a couple of things (I confused <code>next</code> for <code>continue,</code> forgot the %-for-modulo syntax, and used <code>print</code> instead of <code>sys.stdout.write</code>) to make it behave properly.
I have a very long way to go before I&rsquo;m as good at this stuff as I want to be.
But I&rsquo;m confident that I can get there.
A quick exercise like this also helps me work on my &ldquo;real&rdquo; projects, which are not so huge, but feel intimidating to me because they&rsquo;re bigger than I&rsquo;m currently competent for.
The goal of those projects, of course, is to grow into that competency, so I have to keep going.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Malcolm Gladwell, in his book <em>Outliers</em>, mentions that for labor to be meaningful, it must have three properties.
There must be a clear relationship between work and reward.
The work must have a degree of complexity.
The work must be autonomous.
In an interview, he put it like so:</p>

<blockquote><p>Meaningful work is one of the most important things we can impart to children.
Meaningful work is work that is autonomous.
Work that is complex, that occupies your mind.
And work where there is a relationship between effort and reward — for everything you put in, you get something out…
If you are convinced that the work you are doing is meaningful, then curiosity, there&rsquo;s no cost to it.
If you think there&rsquo;s always got to be a connection between what you put in and what you get out, then of course you&rsquo;ll run off with a great excitement after an idea that catches your eye.</p></blockquote>

<p>After reading that, I was struck by a realization - I never want to do another job that&rsquo;s not meaningful.
<strong>Not ever.</strong>
And I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to have to do one either.</p>

<p>I think that humans should do exactly two types of labor: jobs that only humans can do, and jobs that individual humans are actively enthusiastic about doing.
Everything else should be left to robots and software.
We all deserve better than toil, than work that only benefits others, than work without end or reward or satisfaction.</p>

<p>In all of the crappy-job stories I&rsquo;ve heard, this has been a common factor - that the job was not meaningful in the sense explained above.
It may have manifested through a controlling boss, bad tools, abusive customers, bumbling coworkers, or any of a wide variety of things, but that&rsquo;s what it boiled down to - a job that didn&rsquo;t occupy the mind, didn&rsquo;t give you autonomy, and didn&rsquo;t yield a relationship between effort and reward.
All of these things are pitfalls for employers (and the last one <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/blog-entry/see-you-court-quote-day-long-and-short-it">a pitfall for governments, too</a>): if the work that your company does lacks one or more of these things, you will not be able to hold onto good workers, and you are destined for eventual extinction.
As Seth Godin points out - <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/the-difference-between-hiring-and-recruiting.html">if you couldn&rsquo;t <em>recruit</em> for your job opening instead of hiring for it</a>, you might want to consider whether you&rsquo;ll actually attract the people you&rsquo;d really want working for you.
No job that is not meaningful labor will ever be worth quitting another job for.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is one of the biggest mistakes that both employees and employers can make.
Employees should feel zero guilt about walking away from an employment situation without meaningful work in favor of one that does.
Employers should recognize that they do not deserve and will not retain employee loyalty, competency, or performance in an environment where workers don&rsquo;t have autonomy, labor that requires their brains, and a relationship between effort and reward.
I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the continuing trend of globalization, of a global labor market, but one of the positive things that I hope for out of it is an increased willingness and ability on employees' part to say - screw this, I can do better - and leave a job for something better.
This is a right that some people would dearly like to deny to employees, for predictable reasons.</p>

<p>Of course, this whole spiel definitely comes from a highly privileged place: I&rsquo;m lucky to be in the 2% of the world&rsquo;s population who won&rsquo;t get laughed out of the room when they talk about things like this, the very top percentile of the global population who has a good chance of achieving a life of doing meaningful work.
But being in that 2% means that I&rsquo;m wasting the resources I was born with if I don&rsquo;t bust my butt to achieve meaningful work, and it means that I&rsquo;m behaving heartlessly to the rest of the world if I don&rsquo;t insist that everyone deserves as much.
I am, and I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve come across an interesting dynamic with my textbooks.
I tend to pick up a couple of new ones every six weeks or so because of my school schedule.
They&rsquo;re necessary for a relatively short time, which means that I don&rsquo;t have much inertia when a &ldquo;do I get rid of this?&rdquo; decision comes up.
I have a very strong inertia for books - I hate getting rid of things in general, I have a distinct case of &ldquo;but I might use that!&rdquo; and that means that I have a hard time getting rid of books normally.</p>

<p>The textbooks, however, get around this.
I don&rsquo;t own them for long enough that inertia overrides other factors, and while I do develop an emotional relationship with them, it&rsquo;s antagonistic sometimes, so that&rsquo;s a wash.
Importantly, there&rsquo;s also a decision point every six weeks or so where I can get actual money for the books.
So I get to ask myself - will this book be valuable enough as a reference work that I want to forgo getting money for it?  Judging my textbooks by that standard has been interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li>CompTIA A+ Guide To Managing &amp; Maintaining Your PC, 6th Edition: A half-assed textbook, and makes a terrible, terrible reference book.
I&rsquo;d have sold it if I could, and right now I&rsquo;m trying to figure out a way to give it away constructively.</li>
<li>70-270: Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows XP Professional: Hideously dated despite XP sticking around, would sell it if I could, but no such luck.
Same for the accompanying exercise book.
Microsoft Press is not endearing its products to me, and I bet I&rsquo;ll have to deal with more of them in the future.</li>
<li>MS Office Textbook, title not recalled: Absolute junk, got rid of it as soon as possible, a gratuitously bad reference work and for my frame of mind an even worse textbook.</li>
<li>CompTIA Net+ Study Guide: Has significant flaws - its security chapters are long on &ldquo;woooo, evil hackers!&rdquo; and on goofy names for attacks - but overall it&rsquo;s worth keeping for reference.
Author attempts to be hip and with it, very mixed results, but at least doesn&rsquo;t sound like the soulless corporate drone who wrote the A+ Guide.</li>
<li>Lynda.com Dreamweaver CS3 Hands-On Training: Thoroughly mediocre, has a fawning, sales-brochure tone about the product.
The class is inspiring a hearty contempt for Dreamweaver, as recently seen on this blog, so there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m keeping this one.</li>
<li>Adobe Classroom In A Book Flash CS3 Professional: Also crap, also a sales brochure for the product (although I expect it a little more, similar to what I expect from Microsoft Press).
Mildly more worth as a reference work and mildly better software, still not keeping it.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to classes like I took in my first attempt at college, where it was a lecturer and an O'Reilly book or two.
O'Reilly books, whether meant as textbooks or not, generally retain a lot of value as reference works - it&rsquo;s pretty much universal across computer folk that they&rsquo;ll have O'Reilly books sitting around.
Most of them have better typography and design than the glossy textbooks I&rsquo;ve been using, too.</p>

<p>This ties into a general crankiness of mine about shiny things.
I mistrust them.
Past a very low threshhold, it&rsquo;s <em>hard</em> to make additional dollars spent on thick pages, color printing, and big pictures pay off in better information absorption/retention rates.
More commonly, extra money spent on prettying things up will have no effect on those rates, and be wasted - be spent on things besides rigorous <em>content</em>.
I feel like money misspent in that direction is money spent to deceive me, and money that results in higher prices because it adds features that I don&rsquo;t value.
I want <em>content</em>.
As a result, I like the O'Reilly books because they put aside the temptation to be shiny and deliver excellent content, reliably.</p>

<p>This is also the reason why I want this web site to get more spare and lean in the future.
I want it to be a web site that I&rsquo;d want to read.
There is a place for bright color and CSS tricks and busy graphics.
That place is not on a page where the primary content is straight text.
When straight text is the content, everything else is a distraction.
I aspire to the Tuftean ideal where communicating data well is the entire task of the page - no wasted &ldquo;ink&rdquo; at all.</p>
