  <div class="entry-content"><p>Malcolm Gladwell, in his book <em>Outliers</em>, mentions that for labor to be meaningful, it must have three properties.
There must be a clear relationship between work and reward.
The work must have a degree of complexity.
The work must be autonomous.
In an interview, he put it like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meaningful work is one of the most important things we can impart to children.
Meaningful work is work that is autonomous.
Work that is complex, that occupies your mind.
And work where there is a relationship between effort and reward — for everything you put in, you get something out…
If you are convinced that the work you are doing is meaningful, then curiosity, there’s no cost to it.
If you think there’s always got to be a connection between what you put in and what you get out, then of course you’ll run off with a great excitement after an idea that catches your eye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reading that, I was struck by a realization - I never want to do another job that’s not meaningful.
<strong>Not ever.</strong>
And I don’t want anyone else to have to do one either.</p>

<p>I think that humans should do exactly two types of labor: jobs that only humans can do, and jobs that individual humans are actively enthusiastic about doing.
Everything else should be left to robots and software.
We all deserve better than toil, than work that only benefits others, than work without end or reward or satisfaction.</p>

<p>In all of the crappy-job stories I’ve heard, this has been a common factor - that the job was not meaningful in the sense explained above.
It may have manifested through a controlling boss, bad tools, abusive customers, bumbling coworkers, or any of a wide variety of things, but that’s what it boiled down to - a job that didn’t occupy the mind, didn’t give you autonomy, and didn’t yield a relationship between effort and reward.
All of these things are pitfalls for employers (and the last one <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/blog-entry/see-you-court-quote-day-long-and-short-it">a pitfall for governments, too</a>): if the work that your company does lacks one or more of these things, you will not be able to hold onto good workers, and you are destined for eventual extinction.
As Seth Godin points out - <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/the-difference-between-hiring-and-recruiting.html">if you couldn’t <em>recruit</em> for your job opening instead of hiring for it</a>, you might want to consider whether you’ll actually attract the people you’d really want working for you.
No job that is not meaningful labor will ever be worth quitting another job for.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is one of the biggest mistakes that both employees and employers can make.
Employees should feel zero guilt about walking away from an employment situation without meaningful work in favor of one that does.
Employers should recognize that they do not deserve and will not retain employee loyalty, competency, or performance in an environment where workers don’t have autonomy, labor that requires their brains, and a relationship between effort and reward.
I’m uncomfortable with the continuing trend of globalization, of a global labor market, but one of the positive things that I hope for out of it is an increased willingness and ability on employees’ part to say - screw this, I can do better - and leave a job for something better.
This is a right that some people would dearly like to deny to employees, for predictable reasons.</p>

<p>Of course, this whole spiel definitely comes from a highly privileged place: I’m lucky to be in the 2% of the world’s population who won’t get laughed out of the room when they talk about things like this, the very top percentile of the global population who has a good chance of achieving a life of doing meaningful work.
But being in that 2% means that I’m wasting the resources I was born with if I don’t bust my butt to achieve meaningful work, and it means that I’m behaving heartlessly to the rest of the world if I don’t insist that everyone deserves as much.
I am, and I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve come across an interesting dynamic with my textbooks.
I tend to pick up a couple of new ones every six weeks or so because of my school schedule.
They’re necessary for a relatively short time, which means that I don’t have much inertia when a “do I get rid of this?” decision comes up.
I have a very strong inertia for books - I hate getting rid of things in general, I have a distinct case of “but I might use that!” and that means that I have a hard time getting rid of books normally.</p>

<p>The textbooks, however, get around this.
I don’t own them for long enough that inertia overrides other factors, and while I do develop an emotional relationship with them, it’s antagonistic sometimes, so that’s a wash.
Importantly, there’s also a decision point every six weeks or so where I can get actual money for the books.
So I get to ask myself - will this book be valuable enough as a reference work that I want to forgo getting money for it?  Judging my textbooks by that standard has been interesting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CompTIA A+ Guide To Managing &amp; Maintaining Your PC, 6th Edition: A half-assed textbook, and makes a terrible, terrible reference book.
I’d have sold it if I could, and right now I’m trying to figure out a way to give it away constructively.</li>
  <li>70-270: Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows XP Professional: Hideously dated despite XP sticking around, would sell it if I could, but no such luck.
Same for the accompanying exercise book.
Microsoft Press is not endearing its products to me, and I bet I’ll have to deal with more of them in the future.</li>
  <li>MS Office Textbook, title not recalled: Absolute junk, got rid of it as soon as possible, a gratuitously bad reference work and for my frame of mind an even worse textbook.</li>
  <li>CompTIA Net+ Study Guide: Has significant flaws - its security chapters are long on “woooo, evil hackers!” and on goofy names for attacks - but overall it’s worth keeping for reference.
Author attempts to be hip and with it, very mixed results, but at least doesn’t sound like the soulless corporate drone who wrote the A+ Guide.</li>
  <li>Lynda.com Dreamweaver CS3 Hands-On Training: Thoroughly mediocre, has a fawning, sales-brochure tone about the product.
The class is inspiring a hearty contempt for Dreamweaver, as recently seen on this blog, so there’s no way I’m keeping this one.</li>
  <li>Adobe Classroom In A Book Flash CS3 Professional: Also crap, also a sales brochure for the product (although I expect it a little more, similar to what I expect from Microsoft Press).
Mildly more worth as a reference work and mildly better software, still not keeping it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m looking forward to classes like I took in my first attempt at college, where it was a lecturer and an O’Reilly book or two.
O’Reilly books, whether meant as textbooks or not, generally retain a lot of value as reference works - it’s pretty much universal across computer folk that they’ll have O’Reilly books sitting around.
Most of them have better typography and design than the glossy textbooks I’ve been using, too.</p>

<p>This ties into a general crankiness of mine about shiny things.
I mistrust them.
Past a very low threshhold, it’s <em>hard</em> to make additional dollars spent on thick pages, color printing, and big pictures pay off in better information absorption/retention rates.
More commonly, extra money spent on prettying things up will have no effect on those rates, and be wasted - be spent on things besides rigorous <em>content</em>.
I feel like money misspent in that direction is money spent to deceive me, and money that results in higher prices because it adds features that I don’t value.
I want <em>content</em>.
As a result, I like the O’Reilly books because they put aside the temptation to be shiny and deliver excellent content, reliably.</p>

<p>This is also the reason why I want this web site to get more spare and lean in the future.
I want it to be a web site that I’d want to read.
There is a place for bright color and CSS tricks and busy graphics.
That place is not on a page where the primary content is straight text.
When straight text is the content, everything else is a distraction.
I aspire to the Tuftean ideal where communicating data well is the entire task of the page - no wasted “ink” at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This, like the Flash post, is an angry post.
Also like Flash, I have a class that consists basically of “learn to use this Adobe product.”  That’s not inherently bad, but it has some problems - especially when you combine it with a textbook that is also a sales brochure for the thing that it’s teaching you to use.
I think that that’s unethical and usually a sign of a cruddy textbook.</p>

<p>Dreamweaver, like Flash, is basically past its sell-by date.
Its feature-set is best for the low-end, but as a member of Adobe’s Creative Suite of apps, it’s priced for the high end.
If you’re just tinkering with web sites, with static pages, it might be helpful - but it’s also quite likely to be overwhelming.
If you’re on the high end, writing web content in PHP/Ruby/Python, Dreamweaver is probably going to be inadequate, especially if you’ve already got your own IDE and content management.
I can’t see a good spot in the market for it.
I’ll grant that it would have been an amazing tool to have in 1999, and to Macromedia’s credit, it <em>was</em> pretty dang good in 1999.
But it hasn’t been 1999 for a long time now.</p>

<p>Modern web content creation has simply outgrown Dreamweaver.
This is less speculative than with Flash - Dreamweaver is straight-up inadequate, and its presence in business environments is a sign of clinging to legacy commitments that are long-term losers.
Anything Dreamweaver can do can probably be accomplished for free with fewer licensing headaches and a lower workstation and server resource footprint.</p>

<p>Despite the kvetching about Dreamweaver and Flash, I’m pretty fond of Adobe.
Dreamweaver and Flash both <em>had</em> a useful lifetime, which is more than you can say for some products, and as corporations go, Adobe is fairly non-evil.
But right now, it looks like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001296.html">any application that <em>can</em> be written in JavaScript, <em>will</em> eventually be written in JavaScript.</a> This is trouble for Adobe, one of the giants of desktop software, a company with a lot to lose by anyone’s measure.
They’ve responded with Adobe Air, which is nice, but seems unlikely to replace browsers for the tasks that Adobe’s core apps address.
What else is Adobe doing to move to the next paradigm?
I hope it’s doing something, because we’re seeing irrefutable evidence in the music, movie, and dead-tree industries that trying to sue the next paradigm out of existence is a loser’s game and just ensures that you won’t make money on what comes next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don’t know yet whether I’ll professionally be a developer or a sysadmin.
I’d be happy doing either, and I’m going to keep tinkering with both vocations in my personal life.
However, I know that in both roles, I’ll need to explain what I’m doing to other people and convince them that it’s valuable.</p>

<p>In a job I held years ago, a Geek Squad type of gig, I was doing this wrong.
I was excessively humble, and I failed to convince my boss that what I did was worth the time.
I presented it as easier than it was, and I assumed that as another technical person, he would understand the true time and effort cost involved in my work.
That wasn’t true.
This was made worse by the generational difference between me and my boss.
I probably should have taken the hint when I discovered that he had a smartphone but didn’t use it for email and wouldn’t use SMS messages.
I lost that job because while I was working hard, I wasn’t convincing my boss of the value of my work and I wasn’t making my work visible to him.</p>

<p>So: don’t do that!  As a developer or a sysadmin, you are a specialist.
That means that people outside your specialty don’t understand what you do - and very often, that extends to not understanding its value or its difficulty.
Speak up.
Use a different standard than you do with your peers in your discipline.
You have to use the skill-set traditionally associated with sales - and that can be problematic, because “sales” and “advertising,” to technical people, generally mean “people lying and not getting punished for it.”
The skills toolbox is still valuable - for technical people, it’s probably best to think of it as open communications and standards.
Publish your personal standards, so that everyone who contacts you knows what you need to do and its difficulty level.
That openness will help to prevent people from dismissing your effort and considering it trivial.
You don’t want people to think that your work is trivial - many problems lie in that direction.</p>

<p>In turn, you and I need to cultivate an awareness that other people’s work is not trivial either.
I’m fond of Joel Spolsky’s article about the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html">“Developer Abstraction Layer.”</a> As a specialist, you’ll often be in a position where other people’s effort is invisible to you.
That’s good when it lets you get your own work done more efficiently - but bad when it blinds you to the value of others’ contributions.
Part of the trade-off of specialization is that you are more aware of the difficulty of tasks within your specialization’s problem domain than of the difficulty of tasks outside it - and as a human, you tend to underestimate the difficulty of those extradisciplinary tasks.
That is a trap - and it’s another reason to have good communication skills.
If you can build rapport with people quickly, it’s less likely that you’ll need to care about the tasks in the problem domain of their specialty.
You can trust them just do their work with their specialty and tell you about the results - the same as you do for them.</p>

<p>Specialization is valuable, but don’t let it turn into contempt for those outside your specialty or blind you to the difficulty of tasks in other specialties.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last post, about the lessons that Wizards of the Coast has for software developers, had many oversimplifications.
One of them is this: Wizards of the Coast actually is a software developer.
They have an online version of their product (clearly labeled as “Magic: The Gathering Online”) that they develop in-house.
MTGO is pretty terrible.
It’s a passable program that spent years being a crappy program.
It was a perfect example of how monopolies produce shitty products.
It’s still the only remotely serious product in its specific market (part of how the monopoly exists is that they can offer value-adds that no one else can).</p>

<p>This shouldn’t be surprising, though.
One thing that makes it unsurprising is that, as Nathan Bowers likes to say, <a href="http://uxhero.com/ux-theory/quality-is-fractal/">Quality Is Fractal</a>.
Look at the <a href="http://www.magicthegathering.com/">Magic: The Gathering web site</a>.
It survives and thrives because there’s good content in there, but in many ways it’s a design trainwreck.
Similarly, you could look at Magic itself.
Another thing that I omitted in the last post is Magic’s bugs.
Magic’s creators are making a game that is played by humans against humans, so the game needs to be fair.
To that end, Wizards maintains a list of banned and restricted cards that have to be treated differently so that the game remains fair.
The game contains over 10,000 cards as of this writing, and a bit over 100 have ever been on the banned/restricted list (which grows and shrinks over time).
Any card that creates enough problems to go on the list can be considered roughly equivalent to a showstopper bug in your average software program - and making it onto the list means that the “bug” made it into the wild instead of being caught during QA.
So despite Magic’s impressive QA operation, bugs still get by them.</p>

<p>Making complex products - like Magic or a piece of software - isn’t easy.
We have a whole industry built on top of our tradition of telling other people how to do things, and still the complexity of the world stymies us.
To our great benefit, we’ve advanced to the point where we can actually solve some problems by throwing lots of computing resources at them.
Other problems, however, still need a lot of human thought and creativity put into them before they’re soluble, and the best that we can hope for is that we can add computing resources that will let us most efficiently allocate our human thought and creativity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wizards of the Coast is a great software developer, and you’ve probably never thought of them that way because they don’t make software.
They make a card game - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a> was a 1990s phenomenon and is one of the only card games of its time to survive.
At this point, it’s not competing with other card games: it’s really competing with World of Warcraft and tabletop roleplaying games.
They are successful in a way that software developers can learn from: they gather huge amounts of testing data, they release regularly, and they make sure that their developers are in frequent contact with their users.</p>

<p>Skip this paragraph if you already know how Magic works.
Magic is a collectible card game.
Wizards of the Coast prints new Magic cards four times a year.
Players buy cards in cheap randomized bunches or as expensive singles.
From their cards, players construct decks and play against one another.
They play casually and in tournaments.
Tournaments have prizes, but you can only participate in tournaments with a deck of the right format - tournaments may require decks from the last two-or-so years of cards printed, the last seven-or-so years of cards printed, or a very large subset of all cards ever printed.
Wizards of the Coast runs a series of high-profile high-prize events, and entering these events requires registering the list of cards that you used to build your deck.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast has been making Magic for seventeen years, and they have gathered more and more testing data as time goes on.
They gather a ridiculous amount of data about how their game is used through their Organized Play initiative, representing the usage patterns of millions of worldwide users.
All of the most intensive users of their product are sending big streams of feedback data - and not just opinion, they’re sending behavioral data, speaking through action.
Every Magic user has a goal in mind when they use the “software,” and Wizards has set up a huge dragnet to gather data about how users tried to get to that goal and how successful they were.
This isn’t all the data, either.
As any given version of Magic ships, internally, the company is testing the next two versions.
This gives them a great way of testing the accuracy of their internal testing: they have a lot of external usage data to compare to the predictions that internal testing made when they were developing a given version.
If you were developing a web app, this is the kind of performance and usage data you’d really want: a huge corpus of data about what people wanted, what they tried doing in order to get it, and whether or not they got it.</p>

<p>The data-gathering that Magic’s creators do synergizes with their release schedule: they release a new version four times a year without fail.
Their business model requires this - it’s a model that should sound familiar.
They have an entertainment product that doesn’t depreciate in value when it gets into consumers’ hands, that people form emotional attachments to, and that can be easily transferred from one consumer to another.
Wizards of the Coast has demonstrated a lesson that the RIAA, MPAA, and publishing houses could learn from.
Instead of evilly and stupidly punishing their consumers for liking their product, they are <em>constantly adding value</em>.
They have gathered into their company the best damn card-game designers around: because of the economics of collectible card games, in the long run a competent CCG designer is overwhelmingly likely to be either employed by Wizards of the Coast or not employed as a CCG designer at all.
They have hired smart, they realize the limitations of their core product, and they are constantly innovating.
They sell accessories of all kinds.
They sell ancillary goods of all kinds.
They translate their product into other media with abandon, seeing what works and what doesn’t.
They do not, it is important to note, sue their customers.
Magic isn’t a perfect parallel to music, movies, or books, but I believe it demonstrates that it’s possible to make money without also making your customers hate you.
If your customers hate you, they will flee as soon as an appealing alternative presents itself - a phenomenon we’ve seen numerous times in the last decade and change.
By behaving evilly, the previous generations of media companies are ensuring that newer media companies will out-compete them.
Wizards, instead, is choosing to actually remain competitive.</p>

<p>Of course, you have an elevated risk of being distanced from your customers and alienated from them if you never talk to them.
Wizards has avoided that very deftly.
They <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Default.aspx">publish lots of material for their community</a>, and the designers of the game solicit feedback directly.
If you write to Mark Rosewater, the man who currently has more power over the direction of Magic than any other human, you will get a reply.
If you go to a major Magic tournament, you will find delegates from Wizards’ development team.
Sometimes they will be observing, but quite often they’ll be “gunslinging,” playing the game against anyone who wants to take them on.
Magic’s creators <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_one%27s_own_dog_food">eat their own dogfood</a> and are highly exposed to the public.
They are not losing touch with their customers or regarding them as just numbers.
They are exposed, directly, to issues with their product - and they respond to those issues.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast gathers enormous amounts of data about their users’ experience with their product, they are constantly adding value to their product, and they don’t hide from their users.
When you look at software companies that are doing well, and especially at the ones that have become universally recognized names, I believe that you’ll find them doing the same things.
These strategies work everywhere: there’s no excuse for screwing them up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In late 2009, I rebooted my professional life, and as 2010 rolls around, I’m just about making it out of POST.
I’m back in college in Santa Rosa.
This means that I’m thinking about the learning process, especially as I watch my classmates.
It’s both encouraging and discouraging to watch the people who are going through school with me.
On the bright side, I’m doing well compared to my classmates.
That smugness withers, though, when I remind myself that I don’t believe that anyone is just plain stupid.
I have a high opinion of human potential.
I think that if you see stupid behavior from people, <em>there is a reason.</em> So it bothers me a little that my classmates have some difficulty with things that seem easy to me.</p>

<p>One explanation that I turn to a lot is the frameworks explanation.
Being a good developer or sysadmin requires a lot of understanding of how computers think, and how to tell them to think other things.
This is abstract and demanding, and as much of a pain in the butt as it is to learn the finicky specifics of a given OS, protocol, or programming language, it’s still easier than learning abstract concepts from zero.
It’s also easier to teach that way.</p>

<p>The problem is that if you learn specifics and specifics and specifics, you’ll hit a wall eventually.
Efficiency will drop, or you’ll stop absorbing new things as readily, or you’ll have to spend more time trying to remember which set of things you’re dealing with.
You need a model, a framework for understanding things, a set of patterns in your head.
The transition from memorizing specifics to exploring patterns and frameworks is important, and I think it’s important and under-addressed.
I’d like to see my school address it explicitly.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t give people lessons in bridging the gap between specifics and frameworks, pointing out that it exists and that it needs to be bridged will give students a push in the right direction.
Figuring out frameworks isn’t impossible—but generally, one needs help, and the simplest form of help is pointing out that the problem exists.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am writing while angry.
One of my current classes is in Flash.
As a result, I’m installing <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/">Flash CS3</a> at home so that I can experiment with it outside of the school’s labs and so that I can work on Flash assignments at my own pace.</p>

<p>Flash’s installer is terrible.</p>

<p>Among the first things that it does is to boldly fall face-first into the pavement of prerequisites.
It tells me that it’s installing some browser widgets and that I must quit Firefox.
This is shoddy design.
I accept, happily, that in the course of installing Flash, I must install some Flash-viewing software for my browser.
However, you don’t get to restart my browser.
Firefox already has a mildly elegant mechanism for installing extensions to its functionality.
It installs them and then tells me “okay, restart the browser when you want to use this.”  It does things on my schedule.
Not using that mechanism, when it exists, is poor workmanship.
As it happened, I was at a low ebb of Firefox usage at the time.
Normally I have 50 tabs open spread across multiple windows, making <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4199">restarting the browser</a> a bit time-consuming.</p>

<p>I put my attention elsewhere and kept working with the installer running in the background.
Then I rebooted.
Excuse me, that was the wrong pronoun.
<em>It</em> rebooted.
This splits into two problems.
One is that Windows programs very often demand a system reboot unjustifiably.
I have to suppose that that’s related to problems with Windows itself.
The other is that Flash CS3 in particular rebooted without giving me a choice in the matter.
Either the installer stole focus and it heard the right keystrokes for “go ahead and reboot” in the middle of the command I was typing, or it just rebooted without giving me a confirmation dialogue box.
The first is extremely bad, and the second is demonstrate-the-power-of-this-fully-armed-and-operational-battlestation bad.
I’m not going to bother spending time on why the second one is bad - if you don’t get that it’s bad to do that and why, I forbid you to become involved in any way in creating software.
If you meet the person responsible for this feature of the Flash installer in an alcohol-serving setting, throw a drink in their face.</p>

<p>Stealing focus is one of the classic user experience sins.
It is pure hubris.
It says “this application exists for <em>our</em> needs, not for our users’ needs.”  That is pride, and that is a great reason for your users to take their business somewhere else.
If your product doesn’t exist for your customers’ needs, why should they (we) care about it?  Back on stealing focus: even though Mac OS X’s bouncing Dock icons can get obnoxious, they’re at least an intuitive way of communicating “hey, this application needs your attention!”  Windows has flashing taskbar entries and system-tray notifications (which are usually used badly, but that’s no reason not to use them).
Your application shouldn’t steal focus from what the user is actually doing for anything short of “your computer will physically explode unless you click a button in the next 30 seconds.”</p>

<p>I learned this from <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/biggest-mistakes-in-web-design-1995-2015.html#1">Vincent Flanders</a>, myself.
It is a pole star of design.
You design <strong>for your users</strong>, not for yourself or for your organization.
Even if you are a rock star like <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html">The Steve</a>, you design for users.
Even if your application is (like Adobe’s Flash creation tools) targeted at developers, those are your users, and you design for them.
The targeting of developers actually makes Flash’s terrible installer even more problematic.
If the profit center for Flash were content consumers, it’d be at least vaguely justifiable for the content creation software to have problems.
But instead, Flash makes money by selling content creation software.
It is free to content consumers.
You’d suppose that Adobe would like to make the content creators happy, then, since they’re the ones that are actually giving Adobe money.</p>

<p>Instead, Flash is dying.
I can’t bring myself to be sad about that, even putting aside the problems I just had with installing Flash.
Flash is great for embedding video.
That’s it.
I can’t think of anything else Flash does that can’t be imitated with a combination of CSS and JavaScript, with better SEO, better accessibility, and cheaper content-creation tools.
Now we’ve got HTML5, a standard getting ever closer, and it includes video and audio embedding that don’t need Flash, nor do they open the user up to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=flash+zero+day+exploit">Flash’s numerous security problems</a>.</p>

<p>This is all moderately predictable, too.
Despite the existence of Silverlight (too little, too late), Flash was essentially a monopoly for a while.
Predicting that monopolies will deliver shitty products is pretty easy.
It’s what monopolies do, and it’s part of why HTML5 is a better solution than Silverlight.
Silverlight would have made things into a competition between Adobe and Microsoft, which is better than a monopoly, but not as good as the HTML5 solution, which doesn’t require installing additional software and lets people concentrate on more interesting problems than embedding video.
Silverlight is just more of <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html">Flash’s problems</a>: not searchable, poor accessibility, security issues.
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/html5_video_unusable">HTML5 has its own problems</a>, but they’re vendor-independent.</p>

<p>I will take this class, I will attain baseline competency in Flash, and I will keep Flash the hell out of any web site I author.
It is a product whose time is up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because writing about things clarifies your thinking about them.
Because while I am a system administrator and a developer, I am also a writer: it would be a huge damn struggle to get me to give up either writing or tinkering with computers - at this point, both of them are things that I <em>have</em> to do to really be myself and to feel at home in the world.
I could try to put in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29">Gladwell-style 10,000 hours</a> on something else.
There are many, many, <em>many</em> awesome disciplines in the world.
But these are the ones that speak to me.</p>

<p>Sometimes the “here I am and here’s why I’m writing my blog” post comes first.
I don’t want to do that.
I want <em>content</em> to come first at this blog.
Good content is the gold standard of the Internet, forgiving all other sins, and without it a blog is nothing.
So this post and this blog are training me to put content first.
Part of what makes content good is that it appears on a regular, predictable schedule - for example, this blog’s Monday-Wednesday-Friday posts.
Good content comes before hearing about me, because while some of you are surely here for me (hi Uncle Brian!), most of you are here because something’s in it for you - that content.</p>

<p>This blog is also here because without it, I don’t exist.
I’m an apprentice as I write this in all of my competencies.
I am listening, in this area, to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/">Jeff Atwood</a> and <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> and <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/">Teresa and Patrick Nielsen Hayden</a>.</p>

<p>I’m especially influenced by Godin’s <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/why-bother-havi.html">“Why bother having a résumé?”</a> post.
Godin says that <em>“if you’re remarkable, amazing or just plain spectacular, you probably shouldn’t have a resume at all.”</em> I’m going to be remarkable, amazing, and spectacular eventually - but I’m not yet, and won’t become so without lots of work.
I won’t get there without preparing the way.
Preparing the way means writing and being present on the Internet - part of the big conversation going on.
I’m not really writing this blog for today or tomorrow, I’m writing it for the next year and the next five years.
I’m writing it so that in 2011, when someone searches for “brighid mcdonnell python,” my blog is the first thing that comes up, showing them who I am and what I’ve been thinking about for years.
I want to show people the things that I want them to judge me by.
If I am not putting things like that out on the Internet, people will judge me (it’s what people do) by things that I do <em>not</em> control, and I like that less.</p>

<p>Welcome to my blog.
I promise two things: to talk about things that don’t bore me, and to talk about them in a way that doesn’t bore you.</p>

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first time that I built a computer for myself was in 1998.
It barely worked, and it was built on a particularly unreliable generation of hard drives, so it died before too long.
I scrounged a few parts from it and built a new computer at the beginning of 2002.
That was where I brought Windows XP into my house for the first time.
It didn’t feel like a huge upgrade from Windows 2000, and I wasn’t a fan of Luna.
To this day, one of the first things I do when I install XP is to get rid of Luna and go back to the Windows 2000 visual scheme because it doesn’t get in the way (we’ll see if Windows 7 makes its chrome worthwhile).</p>

<p>In nearly a decade since then, I’ve been using Windows XP nearly every day, gradually learning how Microsoft thinks by looking at what it produced, learning how other people think by seeing what problems they run into, and learning how I think by seeing what I need to fight to accomplish with Windows and what I can accomplish without thinking about it.
Windows XP is a comfortable, well-worn part of my computing experience, at this point.
I grew up thinking that “Macintosh” and “computer” were synonymous, and the Linux Movement has my heart, but I still use XP every day, and its patterns of thought have influenced mine.</p>

<p>This is why I worry about Windows XP.
Before 1998, I was using computers and the Internet - and making every bit as much of an idiot of myself as you’d expect from someone telling you they were on Usenet through their AOL subscription at the age of 13 - but I wasn’t doing conscious practice, I wasn’t actively learning very much.
I was learning to treat computers as familiar, knowable, and safe, which was very valuable, but I wasn’t learning <em>how they worked.</em> The experience of using a debugger on the OS8 computer that my family kept in the back room taught me pretty much one thing that’s stuck with me: beneath the shiny part of a computer’s interface, there is a universe that we can reach into and experience in a different way.
That experience is a big part of why I want to be a developer.</p>

<p>I want to be a developer the way the average teenager with a guitar wants to be a rock star, which is probably unhealthy.
I’ve mellowed out since I was an actual teenager with a keyboard, and now I’m actually working on that goal instead of just fantasizing about the rewards of achieving it.
I can think of a task and have some idea of how a program would get there, visualize the broad pattern of big chunks of source code to do it.
That’s progress, that’s a bit of growing up.
Growing up, to me, also requires that I leave behind Windows XP.
I like XP, but as it lurches towards its end-of-support date, dying, like Windows 98 and Internet Explorer 6, a protracted, get-on-with-it, curtain-clutching <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> kind of death, I need to face facts.</p>

<p>There are people arguing that the desktop OS overall should have a less prominent role in the future - that the browser is doing most things that people did on the desktop in a way that makes them more productive.
Considering that I rely on Firefox plugins and that I have installed multiple browsers specifically to use as gmail clients, I can’t argue very hard against that.
Windows 7 is here, too, and soon I’ll be grabbing a copy of that and getting my hands dirty.
Lovely thought.
As well, there’s always the allure of going back to Macs: I’m not the first to point out that Apple is a maniacally intense, highly talented design firms that happens to make computers (the iPhone is a handheld computer that happens to contain a phone).
I could hop over to Linux: I’ve already got a bit of a start on a Unix beard, and for a year and more I’ve been using an old desktop as an improvised server and development box.
I’m using emacs, for pity’s sakes.
I should do something else.</p>

<p>I still can’t quite get myself to give up XP.
But I need to.
I grew into being a serious Computer Person with Windows XP - and now I need to pass from apprentice to journeyman, and Windows XP needs a well-deserved rest.
I’ll move away from it.
A year from now, it’ll be easier to focus on the things I hated about it - the twenty damn things that needed doing before an install was usable, for example - but not yet.
Right now, Windows XP has achieved the highest calling of a tool: it has become invisible, I am doing my tasks instead of using the tool.
This distinction will always earn it a friendly memory in the future, regardless of what I end up using to do my day-to-day work.</p>
