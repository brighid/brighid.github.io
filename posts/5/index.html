  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m watching the <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">2010 Google Summer of Code</a> page pretty closely.
Ever since I found out that it existed, last year, I’ve wanted to go for it, and my progress with Python has picked up again recently.
My school schedule has currently changed in such a way that I have nearly three hours of quiet, uninterrupted time that it’s easy to spend in front of a terminal session.
It will not surprise the coders in the audience to learn that this has done wonders for my productivity.
I’m making progress on my current Pylons project and researching contributors to the Summer of Code, considering projects that I could contribute to.</p>

<p>One thing that I like a great deal about the program is that it emphasizes a couple of virtues that our current economic arrangement has nearly downsized out of existence: community contribution and mentorship.
I love that it connects students to their professional community, that it gives them - us, I hope! - a place to start, someplace to begin a career doing what they love.
I have heard the complaint far too many times - and made it far too many times - to be unsympathetic to “how do I get into this business, it seems like there’s no room at all for a beginner.”
With the squeezing-out of apprenticeships and other transitions from student to professional, it’s definitely harder for a lot of us to get into careers doing what we love.
I’m sad about that, and I think that it’s a major bug in the current way that we run our affairs.</p>

<p>But it’s fixable.</p>

<p>I particularly like the Google SOC fix because it also encourages community contribution, giving of oneself in order to make the community better.
Sure, there’s a selfish angle - but I think that productive selfishness like this can get a whole lot done, and it’s pretty easy to encourage people to do it.
Cautiously and prudently directed, selfishness can accomplish very positive things, especially when your definition of selfishness is as broad as mine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Core Security Labs, in <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=223101626">an announcement to the press at the 2010 RSA Security conference</a>, has released a tool that makes it easier to perform attacks on users of the social network Twitter.
Recently, a subspecies of phishing attacks has arisen, called “spearphishing,” and it’s this type of attack that the Core Security Labs tool facilitates.
Most phishing attacks, in which the attacker impersonates a legitimate organization and persuades the victim to give the attacker their credentials, are spammed out, sent to everyone available.
Spearphishing attacks are targeted to smaller groups, to organizations or individuals, and are often more effective because they are tailored to decieve that group specifically by including persuasive details related to the group or person.
As social networks continue to grow in popularity, the information that people share publicly on such networks enable spearphishing attacks.</p>

<p>The CSL tool specifically uses Twitter to perform spearphishing attacks.
A CSL researcher, Pedro Varangot, said that their tool is a framework that can be extended to use other social networks in the attack.
The attack tool framework is built on the open-source programming language Python, a favorite language for projects in the open-source world.
The researchers have not discovered any new software vulnerability - they’ve just found another vector by which to deliver phishing attacks, which are basically social attacks instead of technical attacks.</p>

<p>These attacks are very relevant because they affect Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users.
Phishing attacks try to fool the user much more than they try to fool the computer.
That means that no matter what operating system you use, you’re vulnerable to phishing attacks because you’re still using a human brain.
Most phishing attacks, to IT people, look ludicrously simple to avoid - but there are a lot of them, and the attacker has the advantage that they only need to succeed once to win big.
We defenders need to succeed all of the time just to keep a status quo that’s favorable to us.</p>

<p>Further, this illustrates one of Linux’s major roles in the security world: many major security tools, especially penetration-testing tools like the CSL tool and the Metasploit framework (which some of us saw in action at the RSA conference) are built on Linux.
Linux’s modification-friendliness means that it’s a superior platform for performing attacks.
It’s easier to modify Linux into an attack platform than it is to twist Windows into that role.
Regardless of platform, though, it’s very important for us as IT people to keep in mind that we’ve progressed in security to the point where we humans are the weakest part of the security fence - and so there are more and more attacks that target the weaknesses in human brains instead of in software.
Going forward as IT professionals, all of us will need to be educators about those weakness - and about how to compensate for them.</p>

<p>At least until we have clients and IT users who are not human, which will bring its own set of problems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the themes that I’m developing here is that technical skills aren’t everything.
I blog at all because I believe that communications skills, especially the ability to craft narrative, are super-important.
Today I’m going to write about something else non-technical: ethics.
Ethics is a an ongoing philosophical brawl, really, so I’m only going to make one request of my fellow IT people: choose <strong>one</strong> (1) ethical system, make sure it’s <strong>internally consistent</strong>, and then <strong>stick with it</strong>.</p>

<p>I urge you to do this because even if they seem preachy or nosy, most people don’t actually care about the specifics of your ethical system.
If your behavior - not what you say, your behavior - indicates that you <em>have</em> an ethical system and that your actions are predictable, generally people will be fine.
Predictability equals safety.
This is why, as a cynically pragmatic matter, I don’t advise deception.
For one thing, it’s far too easy for others to mistake a deceptive answer to a technical question as being wrong.
This is to be avoided.
For another thing, a more important thing, if you give a deceptive answer, you commit to keeping that answer consistent with the world - and that’s an enormous task.
You’re either going to have to adjust the world so that it conforms to your answer, or scale up your answer unsustainably.
Deception is much, much harder than it seems.</p>

<p>But take heart: you’re not alone in wrestling with ethical issues, and you may take some cheer in noticing that other people are massively screwing up in their answers to what should be easy ethical questions.
For instance, the system administrator of Harriton High School in Pennsylvania <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/02/fbi-grand-jury-now-probing-high-school-webcam-spying.ars">was spying on students via webcams</a>.
That’s an easy one to avoid.
Don’t do that.
Another individual was <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=31024&amp;tag=col1;post-31024">advancing his career with a fictitious alter ego</a> who sold a bad software product and gave his other self exclusive interviews.
Avoid that too.</p>

<p>On an organizational level, <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/leaked-acta-draft-treaty-reveals-plans-for-internet-clampdown">a treaty is currently being contemplated that would allow the RIAA/MPAA to veto virtually any content on the Internet</a>.
I urge you not to do that either.
Even if you don’t agree with me on that, <a href="http://techliberation.com/2010/02/11/the-government-can-monitor-your-location-all-day-every-day-without-implicating-your-fourth-amendment-rights/">the government is claiming massive surveillance powers through IT</a>, and it behooves you as an IT professional to know about these issues - and to care about them.</p>

<p>As an IT professional, you will have to deal with these.
When someone wants to use IT to serve the implementation of a <em>really bad</em> decision, you the IT professional will be called on to do that implementation - and you need to know, ahead of time, what you’re going to do in that situation.
That’s why you need an internally consistent, reliable ethical model.
If you improvise in a situation like that, the risk of Bad Things happening goes up by quite a lot.
For your own safety, you want predictability.
Don’t be caught flatfooted.</p>

<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/02/the-relentless-search-for-tell-me-what-to-do.html">Seth Godin has a comment</a> that I’d like to repeat - I think it speaks to a common failing that we may succumb to when we have to make decisions like this.
It applies to far more decisions than the ones I’m talking about, but it’s highly relevant here too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People are just begging to be told what to do.
There are a lot of reasons for this, but I think the biggest one is:
“If you tell me what to do, the responsibility for the outcome is yours, not mine.
I’m safe.”</p>

  <p><strong>When asked, resist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go forth and accept responsibility.
That’s what IT people do: we’re responsible for IT.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another month already.
I’m happy with how the Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule is working: it’s like writing to deadline.
That’s part of the point of the exercise, of course - to make writing a discipline, a practice, and to spare myself from some of the paralysis of choice that comes from an open-ended schedule.
I’m not good enough to just blog about whatever, whenever.
Yet.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Still haven’t finished customizing wordpress - I’m going to have to hit up <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> for some of my questions, I think, but happily there’s a bunch of WordPress expertise floating around.</li>
  <li>Best post last month: Definitely <a href="http://stronglyemergent.com/blog/2010/tablet-signal-tablet-noise/">Tablet Signal, Tablet Noise</a>.
I can’t believe I end up writing about Apple this much - but the more I think about design, the more Apple fascinates me.</li>
  <li>Worst post last month: Probably <a href="http://stronglyemergent.com/blog/2010/windows-xp-closure/">Windows XP Closure</a>.
Stream-of-consciousness junk.
There’s probably a good post in that material, but that wasn’t it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only 25 posts in?
It feels like more.
But - step by step is the way.
Practice is the way.
This project is for the long term, and so I’m building the foundations now.
Can’t take shortcuts when building foundations - it’s a bad, bad idea.
I at least have the security of previous writing experience telling me that it does get better and easier over time.
Right now it’s definitely in the dues-paying stage.
I’m also assuming a little extra workload by posting at my college’s blog - that’s interesting, and it makes a good exercise, to write for the audience there and the audience here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, ReadWriteWeb, a group journalism blog about creating Web content, had a problem.
Before I tell you what the problem is, let me show you their response.
<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php">One blog post had the problem</a>.
They found it necessary to add the following announcement to it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Dear visitors from Google.</em>
This site is not Facebook.
This is a website called ReadWriteWeb that reports on news about Facebook and other Internet services.
You can however click here and become a Fan of ReadWriteWeb on Facebook, to receive our updates and learn more about the Internet.
To access Facebook right now, click here.
For future reference, type “facebook.com” into your browser address bar or enter “facebook” into Google and click on the first result.
We recommend that you then save Facebook as a bookmark in your browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who needs that?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Comment#3: ok cool now can I get to facebook</li>
  <li>Comment#5: The new facebook sucks&gt; NOW LET ME IN.</li>
  <li>Comment#6: when can we log in?</li>
  <li>Comment#7: I WANT THE OLD FAFEBOOK BACK THIS SHIT IS WACK!!!!!</li>
  <li>Comment#8: just want to get on facebook</li>
  <li>Comment#9: please give me back the old facebook login this is crazy……………..</li>
  <li>Comment#11: I just want to sign in…………</li>
  <li>Comment#14: wtf is this bullshttttttttttt all about. can i get n plzzzzzzzzz</li>
  <li>Comment#15: What is going on? You are totally confusing me. Knock-knock. Anybody there? Let me in. Katherine</li>
  <li>Comment#17: All I want to do is log in, this sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
</ul>

<p>It goes on in that vein for a while.
I hope that if you’ve read Monday and Wednesday’s posts, that you won’t say “oh for pity’s sake, how stupid can users get?” and instead look more closely at the matter.
In this case, our best guess at what happened is this: RWW posted their article about Facebook.
Google News considers RWW to be a news source - and in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=obama">searches where there are a lot of news results</a> in addition to web results, Google adds News results above the web results.
It clearly labels them as “News results for <strong>Whatever</strong>” - but they are still the top results.
And when your article with the words “Facebook” and “login” in the title is the top result for people who search for “facebook login,” a lot of them will click on it.
You can see the comments they leave when they make the pretty rational assumption that if they Google for “facebook login” and click on the first result, they will be able to log in to Facebook there.</p>

<p>But if you’re reading this, that message that RWW posted probably baffled you.
It baffled <em>them</em> - at first <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_google_failed_internet_meme.php">they thought the comments were a joke</a>.
You probably thought something like “how in the heck could people possibly think that this site is Facebook?”
And that gap is exactly the gap in our perception as IT professionals that I’ve been talking about this week.
We as a community are great - really, really great! - at making tools for other IT professionals, for prosumers, for people who engage with computers for their own sake.
But we still have big problems making tools for everyone else, and that’s basically why Apple kicks our butt again and again.</p>

<p>The discussion about this has died down a bit, especially compared to the talk about Buzz and the iPad, but it’s lively enough.
It spawned lots of good talking points.
<a href="http://funkatron.com/site/comments/were-the-stupid-ones-facebook-google-and-our-failure-as-developers/">Ed Finkler claims that</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[most computer users] do not give a rat’s ass about how computers work.
They want to accomplish certain tasks, and will do this in the way that is most sensible and direct for them.
And the way they end up accomplishing these tasks within the multitasking window motif is typically not the way <em>I</em> would do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over at Quiet Babylonian, <a href="http://quietbabylon.posterous.com/i-have-some-opinions-about-the-rww-facebook-l">Tim Maly opines</a> that
“If you are an interface designer, a brand manager or a security expert, your reaction to this incident should be one of deep humility.”
I’m definitely with them.
We gatekeepers, wizards, and Wise Women of the computer world should definitely be more aware of who is using the computers and the network, and why and how.
The posts that I just linked to are a great start.</p>

<p>I’d be remiss, though, if I didn’t mention counterpoints.
“It is okay to expect people to invest a little time to learn how stuff works and to retain an adequate portion of that education,” barks <a href="http://philcrissman.com/2010/02/16/no-were-not-the-stupid-ones">Phil Crissman</a>.
I don’t think that he’s entirely right, but I definitely agree that one should reasonably expect people, once education has reached them, to stay reached.
He also points out very coherently that <a href="http://philcrissman.com/2010/02/17/why-its-not-a-google-failure">asking Google to solve the problem is asking too much</a>.
There too I agree with him.
This is not a technical problem.
This is a problem with the interface between humans and machines, and it’s on the human side.
That’s why I care about this as a student: I want to make sure that I and all my fellow students know that you can’t implement technical solutions to everything.
People matter - and the way that people think is very unlike the way machines think.
You need to take human factors into account, early, fundamentally, earnestly.</p>

<p>That’s the message of this whole week of posts, really: your technical skills exist in service to the goal of bringing together human effort and technical tools.
If you simply add power to the tools and make them capable of more things, you haven’t done useful work yet: you must ensure that the tools are useful to humans and usable by humans.
Especially by humans who aren’t you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The iPad thing was a relatively clear-cut example of big chunks of the IT punditry, of the conventional wisdom among IT people, being wrong.
The Google Buzz thing is a less clear-cut example, and the debate is still going on.</p>

<p>The Google Buzz “thing” actually needs a little explanation: forgive me if you’ve heard this before.
Google runs a lot of services.
They experiment a lot, and new Google services pop up and expire pretty routinely.
Most of the time, though, they’re pretty invisible: they flicker around in the experimental-features section of major Google services or they fly under the radar in the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/options/">More Google Products</a> and <a href="http://www.googlelabs.com/">Google Labs</a> airspace.
Google Buzz was not quite like that.
It showed up in 175 million Gmail inboxes over the course of a few days.
The results were not pleasant: by default, the privacy options on Buzz were worse than those of notorious publicizer-of-the-private Facebook, and there wasn’t really a way to turn them off.
Google fixed that before too long, but it’s still insecure by default (and to the best of our knowledge, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/01/the-power-of-defaults.html">people rarely change the defaults</a>).</p>

<p>This is not by any means a settled discussion: long and loud, long and loud is the discussion ‘mongst the blogospheric denizens.
Counternotions calls it <a href="http://counternotions.com/2010/02/12/buzz/">“The Big Misdirection,”</a> then points out <a href="http://counternotions.com/2010/02/15/buzzback/">flawed intentions</a>, and most germanely to my point, <a href="http://counternotions.com/2010/02/19/dumber/">examines the difference between testing and judgment</a>.
Tim McCoy wonders <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2010/02/buzzkill.html">“how could they screw up THIS MUCH?”</a></p>

<p>Let me disclaim a little: I like the sound of Buzz, and I hope and expect that it will grow up into an interesting and useful service that will parallel Twitter and Facebook and other conversational tools.
It’s got a nifty conversational dynamic, and hopefully Google’s propensity to add search to everything will help it do things that neither Facebook nor Twitter do well.</p>

<p>Google Buzz, though, illustrates the difference between what’s a good idea for professionals and prosumers and what’s a good idea for everyone.
Buzz assumed, for example, that everyone that you have email conversations with, you want to contact.
That’s definitely not true in all cases, and it’s downright dangerous for some people (the most high-profile example is currently offline, precisely because Buzz’s default settings turned out to be dangerous for her physical safety).
This is a problem that the open-source world has a lot.
Open-source software often makes this assumption: “this is useful for the people who wrote it, so it’ll be useful for others.”  That’s good - but it causes big problems when taken too far.
It’s an assumption that only really works for products and services that people seek out on their own, that they self-select for.
It’s terrible for consumer products, where you make an assertion that it <em>will</em> be useful for most people, or worst of all for something that’s suddenly added to an existing setup - like Google Buzz.
Buzz probably was very useful for the people who created it!  But they lost sight of the fact that it would be used by many, many people besides them.
This is doubly problematic because Google prides itself on the diversity of its workforce, so you’d think that they’d have considered the diversity of needs of their userbase.</p>

<p>And now they’re in trouble and they’re flailing and Buzz - we’ll see if it sticks around.
What we can draw as a lesson, though, is this: <em>understand your users!</em>  You can be a crackerjack programmer or sysadmin, but your skills will be useless if you don’t understand what people need.</p>

<p>As an addendum to Monday’s post, the highly luminous Nathan Bowers has <a href="http://uxhero.com/ux-theory/computers-vs-creativity/">his own explanation about the iPad</a>, and <a href="http://uxhero.com/ux-theory/google-buzz-breaks-the-two-main-rules-of-social-software/">his own take on the matter of Google Buzz</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://stronglyemergent.com/blog/2010/you-can-learn-to-be-lucky/">my last post</a>, I touched on the perception differences between lucky people and unlucky people, comparing them to the perception differences between IT people and regular users.
The differences in thought patterns are very different, and today I’m going to discuss that in more detail.</p>

<p>The first thing I want to discuss is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>.
<a href="http://stronglyemergent.com/blog/2010/tablet-signal-tablet-noise/">Yes, again.</a>
The iPad is a great lens for talking about differences between computer professionals and non-professionals, and part of what makes it a great opportunity to talk about that is that this time, it’s the professionals that Don’t Get It.
Usually we’re egotistical, prone to falling into stories about how those proles, those peasants, those <em>users</em>, don’t get what we’re trying to do here.
But that story completely falls apart here.</p>

<p>The iPad is about making the computer vanish.
I’ve said for quite a while that the computer revolution has already happened - it’s just that most of the computer that affect your life aren’t things that you think of as a “computer.”
They’re in cars, in industry, in stores, in restaurants - and in iPods.
<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2010/02/05/how-to-compete-with-ipad">Matt Gemmell has a great piece about this.</a>
The iPad doesn’t want to be a “computer.”
It wants to be a tablet.
Something that you use to get the Internet and play some games and use some apps.
It abstracts away a lot of what we’ve come to think of as “computer.”
That’s a good thing - for its market.
I’m gratified that Gemmell is on the same page that I am: Apple isn’t competing with most of the people we think it’s competing with.</p>

<p>The thing to notice here is the difference between Computer Professionals and users.
We IT people get hung up on computers because we like them - and we make them an end in themselves.
That’s great for us in our professional roles, but we can’t lose sight of the fact that we’re abnormal in that regard.
For most people, the computer is just a means to an end, and it’s a finicky, mysterious, frustrating means.
Many of the things that Computer Professionals complain about regarding the iPad just <em>do not matter</em> to the actual users that the iPad is targeting.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to the other example I want to talk about, <a href="http://counternotions.com/2010/02/12/buzz/">Google Buzz</a>.
I’ll talk about that on Wednesday, and then on Friday talk about the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php">Facebook/ReadWriteWeb</a> deal.
All of these tie into this theme of perception differences - and I think that all of them point to how we IT people can better be part of the interface between humans and technology.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I stumbled on <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3304496/Be-lucky-its-an-easy-skill-to-learn.html">an article in the Telegraph by Richard Wiseman</a>.
Wiseman ran a study for ten years, selecting both lucky and unlucky people, and looked for common traits among them.
We think of luck as something outside of our control.
Some of it is: there’s nothing you can do to improve your odds in matters of pure chance like the lottery.
But what you <em>can</em> do is look for opportunity.</p>

<p>Consider one experiment, of which Wiseman writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I gave both lucky and unlucky people a newspaper, and asked them to look through it and tell me how many photographs were inside.
On average, the unlucky people took about two minutes to count the photographs, whereas the lucky people took just seconds.
Why? Because the second page of the newspaper contained the message: “Stop counting. There are 43 photographs in this newspaper.”
This message took up half of the page and was written in type that was more than 2 inches high.
It was staring everyone straight in the face, but the unlucky people tended to miss it and the lucky people tended to spot it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are all human, and our brains all operate in similar ways.
One of the things that our brains spend a lot of time doing is deciding what’s important and what’s not before we ever consciously think about it.
That’s good, because you’d rather not spend much time thinking about how to breathe, walk, or eat.
But since so many unconscious decisions are going on, your brain sometimes dismisses important things.
I’m sure we’re all familiar with the opposite, where your brain makes a big deal out of something unimportant.
The good news is that you can train your unconscious mind to be better at noticing the things that matter to you.</p>

<p>Wiseman’s research ties into one of my favorite books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316172324?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stronemerg-20">Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</a> by Malcolm Gladwell.
Gladwell spends a lot of time going through different ways that our unconscious mind can, with training, with proper care and feeding, produce miraculous results.
He and Wiseman also show how badly we can go astray when we abandon responsibility for what we feed our brains.</p>

<p>I’d like to note one important implication this has for IT folks, both for sysadmins and for front-line support people.
A computer professional thinks differently from the people who rely on them.
That’s good, because you need someone who thinks in the same framework that the creators of computer hardware and software do.
However, that can’t be the only thing that an IT person knows how to do.
An IT person must be a translator: they must help messages get from the creators of software to the users.
This is like being a lucky person around unlucky people: because you are thinking differently, you will see different opportunities, you will take different paths, and it may be a little frustrating that the “unlucky” users don’t seem to follow your logic and don’t understand your advice.
Be patient.
In both cases, the skills can be learned.</p>

<p>Learning how to communicate with users takes years.
Learning how to be lucky is also time-consuming, but Wiseman provides us with some more compact advice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlucky people often fail to follow their intuition when making a choice, whereas lucky people tend to respect hunches.
Lucky people are interested in how they both think and feel about the various options, rather than simply looking at the rational side of the situation.
[…] Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine.
They tend to take the same route to and from work and talk to the same types of people at parties.
In contrast, many lucky people try to introduce variety into their lives.
For example, one person described how he thought of a colour before arriving at a party and then introduced himself to people wearing that colour.
This kind of behaviour boosts the likelihood of chance opportunities by introducing variety.
[…] Lucky people tend to see the positive side of their ill fortune.
They imagine how things could have been worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of these things are inherent to a person: you can learn to change your mind, and you should.
Do these things work?  Wiseman claims that they do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I asked a group of lucky and unlucky volunteers to spend a month carrying out exercises designed to help them think and behave like a lucky person.
These exercises helped them spot chance opportunities, listen to their intuition, expect to be lucky, and be more resilient to bad luck.
One month later, the volunteers returned and described what had happened.
The results were dramatic: 80 per cent of people were now happier, more satisfied with their lives and, perhaps most important of all, luckier.</p>
</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I’m going to be taking Microsoft’s 70-270 exam: “Installing, Configuring, and Administering Windows XP Professional.”
Over the weekend, I said goodbye to the XP install that I’d been continuously using for the last five years or so and upgraded to Windows 7.
It’s an interesting transition.
I expect, of course, to pass the test - but even if I don’t, it’s interesting that it lines up with XP bowing out of my personal life.
I’m slated to take a lot of certification tests over the course of 2010.
So far, I’m passing 100% of them, so I feel good about that.
There are questions about how worthwhile certification tests are, and I’m definitely skeptical, but I know that they are worthwhile.
My plan for certification is to say: behold!
My track record is that I took a dozen certifications on a coherent but diverse body of knowledge over the course of the year.
This demonstrates that I can assimilate a body of knowledge fast and apply it.
That’s a valuable thing.</p>

<p>What I wish I knew about certifications is mostly this: why in the heck did Microsoft move away from the MCSE branding and its very high name recognition to “MCITP” and “MCTS”?
It’s very strange - I have to conclude that the MCSE brand somehow became poisoned.
Otherwise, the decision seems irrational.
And with the continued life of Server 2003, people are still looking for MCSEs and MCSAs even when they’re also planning on upgrading to Server 2008.
I’m baffled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the weekend, I installed Windows 7 - only months behind the bleeding edge, but it’s still the New Windows, which carries a certain risk and inconvenience.
I’ll get into that in another post.
Right now, what the existence of Windows 7 means to me is this: there are only two OSes in the world.
There’s NT, and there’s the *NIX family.
Apple dropped its old OS, and its in-house next-generation OS never got off the ground.
Be, Amiga, and OS/2 are all basically pushing up daisies, their user and developer communities enthusiastic but statistically insignificant.
I learned this through Jeff Atwood’s post about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/08/showstopper.html">David Cutler</a>, a man I’m coming to admire.
I think it’s entirely possible that Cutler - irascible, enigmatic, and visionary - is the real Microsoft counterpart to Steve Jobs, not Bill Gates.
Gates and Jobs are both the faces of their computing domains, and have stepped into that role, but in terms of capital-V Vision, it seems to me that Cutler is at the very least the Wozniak to Gates’ Jobs, if not the Jobs himself.</p>

<p>It also makes me think of the Be bug report, “BeOS missing megalomaniacal figurehead to harness and focus developer rage,” now a digital artifact available only through quotation, like Roman-era documents.
I wonder how much a figure like Cutler or Jobs is necessary - and whether the community of developers produces these people, or simply provides a place in which their talents can be productive.
Considering how many such people, in greater or lesser degree, the open-source community has produced, I think it’s entirely possible that there has to be a charismatic, polarizing figure just to get the social dynamics to line up properly to produce good software.</p>

<p>If that’s true, look around you.
Can you spot that person at your software company?
Do you need such a person - and if you do need one and you don’t have one, what can be done about that?</p>
